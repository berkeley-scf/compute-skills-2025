::: {.callout-tip}
## Exercise 1

Where is `gzip` installed on the system? What are some other commands/executables that are installed in the same directory?
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise 1 solution

```bash
type gzip

ls /usr/bin
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Exercise 2

Try to run the following command `mkdir ~/projects/drought`. It will fail. Look in the help information on `mkdir` to figure out how to make it work without first creating the `projects` directory.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise 2 solution

```bash
mkdir -p ~/projects/drought
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Exercise 3

Figure out how to list out the files in a directory in order of decreasing file size, as a way to see easily what the big files are that are taking up the most space. Modify this command to get the result in the ascending order.
:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise 3 solution

```bash
ls -lS
ls -lSr
```
:::

::: {.callout-tip}
## Exercise 4

Figure out how to copy an entire directory and have the timestamps of the files retained rather than having the timestamps be the time that you copied the files.

See if you can combine the short form of an option with the long form of a different option.

What happens if you use a single dash with the long form of an option. Are you able to interpret the error message?

:::

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Exercise 4 solution

```bash
cp -pr mytoy mytoy_copy             # short form
cp --recursive -p mytoy mytoy_copy  # long form plus short form
cp -recursive -p mytoy mytoy_copy   # incorrect long form
cp -r -e -c -u -r -s -i -v -e -p mytoy mytoy_copy
```
